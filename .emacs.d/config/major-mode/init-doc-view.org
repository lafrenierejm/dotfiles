* About This File
  This file contains my configuration for DocView mode.
  This file is written in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]] style using [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][Org mode Babel]].

* Code
** Introductory Boilerplate
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
;;; init-doc-view.el --- Configuration for DocView

;;; Commentary:
;; This file is tangled from init-doc-view.org.
;; Changes made here will be overwritten by changes to that Org file.

;;; Code:
   #+END_SRC
   
** Load DocView with =use-package=
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(use-package doc-view
   #+END_SRC

*** Post-Load Execution
    Because DocView is used to render binary files, I want DocView buffers to automatically refresh when the contents of their corresponding files are changed.
    For the same reason there is no need to attempt to number the lines of DocView buffer.
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  :config
  (add-hook 'doc-view-mode-hook 'auto-revert-mode)
  (add-hook 'doc-view-mode-hook (lambda ()
				  (linum-mode -1) )))
    #+END_SRC

** Ending Boilerplate
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(provide 'init-doc-view.el)
;;; init-doc-view.el ends here
   #+END_SRC
