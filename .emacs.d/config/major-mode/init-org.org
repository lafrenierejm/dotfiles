* About This File
  This file contains my configuration for [[http://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]].
  Org-mode itself is loaded in =[[file:~/.emacs.d/init.org][init.org]]= because =org-babel-tangle= was required to tangle this file.
  This file is written in a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]] style using [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][Org-mode Babel]].
