** Introductory Boilerplate
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
     ;;; init-yaml.el --- Configuration for YAML mode

     ;;; Commentary:
     ;; This file is tangled from init-yaml.org.
     ;; Changes made here will be overwritten by changes to that Org file.

     ;;; Code:
   #+END_SRC
   
** Load =yaml-mode= with =use-package=
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes :noweb yes
     (use-package yaml-mode
       :commands    ; commands provded by the parent package and used below
       (yaml-mode)

       :mode          ; establish deferred binding within `auto-mode-alist'
       (("\\.yml\\'" . yaml-mode)))
   #+END_SRC

** Ending Boilerplate
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
